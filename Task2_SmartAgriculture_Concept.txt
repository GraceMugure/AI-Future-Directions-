Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept â€” Smart Agriculture System

Objective:
To improve crop yield predictions using an AI-driven system supported by real-time data from IoT sensors in agricultural fields.

Required Sensors:
- Soil Moisture Sensor: To monitor soil water levels.
- Temperature Sensor: To track environmental conditions.
- Light Sensor: To measure sunlight exposure.
- Humidity Sensor: To detect atmospheric humidity.
- pH Sensor: To monitor soil acidity.

Proposed AI Model:
A Decision Tree Regression model is proposed for its simplicity and interpretability. It will take real-time sensor data as input and predict the likelihood of optimal crop yield. Over time, the model can be retrained with new data to improve accuracy.

Data Flow Diagram (text description):
1. IoT sensors collect data from the field (e.g., temperature, soil moisture).
2. Data is transmitted to a cloud or edge device using a wireless network.
3. The AI model processes the data to predict crop yield.
4. Results are visualized on a dashboard for the farmer.
5. Actionable insights (e.g., "irrigate now") are sent as alerts.

This system empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, reduce waste, and increase sustainability in agriculture.
